      title: Hobbies
      text: I enjoy creating and building things. Over the years, I’ve developed hobbies in mechanical keyboards and retro gaming devices. For mechanical keyboards, I’ve explored areas like 3D modeling, firmware development, PCB design, vintage keyboard collection, keycap set design, and manufacturing. In the realm of retro gaming devices, I focus on reverse engineering. Below are some of my designs, all of which I have had physically manufactured.
