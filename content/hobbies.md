      title: Hobbies
      text: I enjoy creating and building things. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed hobbies in mechanical keyboards and retro devices. For mechanical keyboards, I engage in 3D modeling, firmware development, and PCB design, and I also collect vintage keyboards and switches. In the realm of retro devices, I focus on reverse engineering. Below are some of my designs, all of which have been physically manufactured.
