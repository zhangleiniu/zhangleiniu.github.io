        - Graph Neural Network for Combinatorial Optimization: Can GNNs perform reasoning and tackle (NP-hard) mathematical problems that traditional algorithms usually solve?
        - Scalable Graph Structure Learning (GSL): GSL often has high time complexity due to the need to compute pairwise node correlations. Can we reduce this time complexity?
        - Gradient-based Neural Architecture Search: Neural network architectures can be represented as graph structures. Can graph neural networks learn the distribution and patterns of these architectures in graph form and generate optimal ones?  
        - Graph Neural Network for Science: For problems that AI has not yet solved, is it possible to formulate them as graph-based challenges and apply GNNs to find solutions?
        - Graph Neural Network Theory: How to bridge the gap between the spatial and spectral graph neural networks? What are the theoretical guarantees of them?
