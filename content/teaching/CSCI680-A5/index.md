## Course Description: 

While existing deep learning methods have seen success with image, video, and text data, many real-world applications fall outside these domains. Graph neural networks—also known as deep learning on graphs or geometric deep learning—have emerged as one of the fastest-growing research areas in machine learning, particularly in deep learning. This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to graph neural networks, covering their foundations, cutting-edge developments, and applications.
