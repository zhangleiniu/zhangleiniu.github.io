title: CSCI 680A5 Machine Learning with Graphs
date: 2024-08/19
---

**Course Description**: While existing deep learning methods have seen success with image, video, and text data, many real-world applications fall outside these domains. Graph neural networks—also known as deep learning on graphs or geometric deep learning—have emerged as one of the fastest-growing research areas in machine learning, particularly in deep learning. This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to graph neural networks, covering their foundations, cutting-edge developments, and applications.

## Communication

- In-class questions
    - Raise your hand 
    - Ask on Slido (might be answered after class)
- Questions about course content or homework assignments
    - Ask on Slido or Blackboard-Discussions
    - Asking good questions or answering other students’ questions may give you bonus
- Questions about course project
    - Ask in-person during my office hours or by appointment
- Feedback is welcome (about content, pace, workload, etc. ): Email me. Anonymous messages are fine, too. 

## Homework Assignment

3 homework assignments 
- Assignments may involve data analysis, coding, and mathematical elements.

## Course Project
- A team consisting of 1-3 students. 
- The proposal must contain:
    - Task Definition: Describe what you plan to do
    - Literature Review: Briefly describe the related work
    - Relationship with your readings
    - Motivation: Describe why your project is important
    - Method: What technique you plan to apply?
    - Evaluation: What would the successful outcome of your project look like?
- The project report is expected to be 4 (abstract/demo) to 8 (full paper) pages long (excluding references) in [IEEE format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn) and should contain the following sections:
    - Introduction
    - Related Work
    - Proposed Method
    - Experiments (codes and datasets should be open to the public) 
    - Results and Discussions
    - Conclusions
    - Contributions of Members
- Grading policy: 
    - You must incorporate a graph neural network in your project, and the use of open-source projects is allowed only with significant modifications.
    - The course project will be graded primarily on its completeness and accuracy.
    - While making original technical contributions is not required, doing so will earn you bonus points.

## Academic Integrity Statement

Good academic work must be based on honesty. The attempt of any student to present as his or her own work that which he or she has not produced is regarded by the faculty and administration as a serious offense. Students are considered to have cheated if they copy the work of another during an examination or turn in a paper or an assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else. Students are guilty of plagiarism, intentional or not, if they copy material from books, magazines, or other sources without identifying and acknowledging those sources or if they paraphrase ideas from such sources without acknowledging them. Students guilty of, or assisting others in, either cheating or plagiarism on an assignment, quiz, or examination may receive a grade of F for the course involved and may be suspended or dismissed from the university.
