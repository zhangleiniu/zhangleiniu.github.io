title: CSCI 680A5 Machine Learning with Graphs
date: 2024-08/19
---

**Course Description**: While existing deep learning methods have seen success with image, video, and text data, many real-world applications fall outside these domains. Graph neural networks—also known as deep learning on graphs or geometric deep learning—have emerged as one of the fastest-growing research areas in machine learning, particularly in deep learning. This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to graph neural networks, covering their foundations, cutting-edge developments, and applications.

## Academic Integrity Statement

Good academic work must be based on honesty. The attempt of any student to present as his or her own work that which he or she has not produced is regarded by the faculty and administration as a serious offense. Students are considered to have cheated if they copy the work of another during an examination or turn in a paper or an assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else. Students are guilty of plagiarism, intentional or not, if they copy material from books, magazines, or other sources without identifying and acknowledging those sources or if they paraphrase ideas from such sources without acknowledging them. Students guilty of, or assisting others in, either cheating or plagiarism on an assignment, quiz, or examination may receive a grade of F for the course involved and may be suspended or dismissed from the university.
